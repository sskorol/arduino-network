# Arduino Networking Library

This library simplifies working with common networking tasks, e.g. exchanging messages over WiFi / MQTT or updating firmware via OTA.

## Installation

Just follow the recommended [PlatformIO instructions](https://platformio.org/lib/show/6373/arduino-network/installation).

In case of any manual updates, you have to clone this repository, make modifications and copy corresponding sources into ./lib/arduino-network (assuming you're using PlatformIO) or Arduino/libraries/arduino-network (in case of Arduino usage) folder.

## Usage

Check [examples](https://github.com/sskorol/arduino-network/tree/master/examples) for details.
