# Arduino Networking Library

This library simplifies working with common networking tasks, e.g. exchanging messages over WiFi / MQTT or updating firmware via OTA.

## Installation

As **arduino-network** is not yet published to official registry, you have to download it manually. Just copy corresponding sources into **./lib/arduino-network** (assuming you're using PlatformIO) or **Arduino/libraries/arduino-network** (in case of Arduino usage) folder.

## Usage

Check [examples](https://github.com/sskorol/arduino-network/tree/master/examples) for details.
